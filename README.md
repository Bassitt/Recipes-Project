# Recipes
# About the Service
The application is just a simple multi-user RESTful service for kitchen recipes sharing. That allows to perform CRUD operations with recipes and provides Basic HTTP authentication. It uses a H2 database to store the data. You can also use any other relational database. If your database connection properties work, you can call some REST endpoints defined in localhost on port 8080.
